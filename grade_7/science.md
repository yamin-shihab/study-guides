# Science 7

I hate this.

## Scientific Method

* There are numerous parts to a scientific experiment.
* A problem statement is a sentence in the form of a testable question. It is mainly: "What effect does (manipulated variable) have on (responding variable)?"
* Background knowledge is previous knowledge that relates to the experiment. It can be definitions.
* A prediction is an educated guess of what will happen and a reason why.
* A hypothesis is like a prediction, but requires to be tested thoroughly and is more detailed.
* To conduct the experiment, a list of materials is needed.
* The procedure is the step-by-step instructions to perform the experiment. They include safety precautions.
* The manipulated (independent) variable is the one condition that's changed in an experiment.
* The responding (dependent) variable is what's being measured.
* Everything that stays the same is a controlled variable. A minimum of three must be stated.
* Observations are the results recorded as data in charts, graphs, diagrams, etc.
* Qualitative observations are made using the five senses.
* Quantitative observations are made with numbers.
* Diagrams are drawn in pencil, placed on the left of the page, neat, and have labels on the right side with straight lines (it's ruler time).
* The conclusion is what was found out (answer and explain the problem), whether the hypothesis was proven or disproven, and sources of error that can be used for accuracy and improvements.
* Always use evidence relating to the experiment when writing about it. You should test an experiment multiple times to confirm the conclusion too.

## Interactions and Ecosystems

* All living things need food, water, a suitable habitat, and gas to exchange.
* Natural resources are the materials and products found in nature.
* Renewable resources are energy resources that can be recycled or replaced by natural processes in less than 100 years
* Non-renewable resources are resources that take millions of years to form.
* Biotic things are living things. (humans, plants, birds, animals, insects)
* Abiotic things are non-living things. (air, water, soil)
* A niche is the role or characteristic activity that is undertaken by an organism in an ecosystem; one organism may fill several niches.
* Producers are plants that use energy from the Sun to make nutrients they need to survive; includes some bacteria that transfer energy from particles.
* Consumers are organisms that eat the food made by producers; can be either herbivores, carnivores, or omnivores.
* A herbivore is an animal that eats only plant material. (grasshopper, beaver, moose)
* A carnivore is an animal that eats other animals. (lynx, wolf, hawk)
* Predation is when animals hunt other animals for food. Prey are being hunted by predators.
* Too many predators and the prey population decreasing (competition for food, leading to decreasing predator populations), and too few predators, prey won't have enough food for all of them since there are more of them.
* An omnivore is an animal that eats other animals and plant material. (bear, raccoon, people)
* A food chain is a sequence of feeding relationships among many living organisms, as they pass on food energy.
* A food web is a network of feeding relationships among organisms.
* A pyramid of numbers is the number of individual organisms at each level of a food chain; the number of organisms decreases with each level higher in the food chain. (there is a greater number of organisms at the bottom of the food chain than at the top)
* Biomass is the total mass of living matter; often expressed in terms of dry weight per unit area.
* A scavenger is an organism that eats dead or decaying plant or animal matter. (carrion beetle, vulture)
* Decomposers are organisms that break down the cells of dead or waste materials and absorb their nutrients. (fungi, bacteria, some worms)
* Ecology is the study of how organisms interact with each other and their environment.
* An ecologist is a scientist who studies interactions between the abiotic and biotic parts of the environment.
* An ecosystem is all the interacting parts of a biological community and its environment.
* A population is a group of organisms of the same species found in a particular geographic area.
* A community is an association of different populations of organisms in a particular environment or geographic area.
* Symbiosis is when two species live closely in a relationship that lasts over time. There are three types.
* Commensalism is when one benefits, and the other neither benefits nor is harmed. (birds and trees)
* Mutualism is when both species benefit. (fish that eat bacteria off of other fish)
* Parasitism is when one benefits and the other is harmed. Parasites live in or on a host and feed on it, but don't want to kill it. (tapeworms, mosquitoes, leeches)
* An adaptation is an inherited characteristic that helps an organism survive and reproduce in its environment.
* Behavioral adaptations change how an organism acts. (plants moving to follow the sun, hibernation, migration)
* Structural/physical adaptations involve change in an organism's body. (blending into the environment, color changing, puffer fishes, webbed feet)
* The carbon cycle is the cycle in which carbon is used and reused through the ecosystem.
* The water cycle is the continuous movement of water through the biosphere.
* Evaporation is the process by which a liquid, such as water, changes into a gas or a vapor.
* Condensation is the process of changing from a gas or vapor to a liquid. (clouds, fog, dew)
* Transpiration is the process in which water that is taken in by a plant or animal evaporates from the organism.
* Precipitation is the water (in its liquid or solid state) that falls to Earth. (rain, snow, sleet, hail)
* Ground water is the water contained in the lithosphere or Earth's crust.
* Run-off is water that runs off the ground into lakes, rivers, or streams.
* Pollution is a collective term for the different types of harmful materials that are released into the environment through human activities.
* Pollutants are substances that cause pollution.
* Acid rain is rain that contains higher than normal levels of acid; caused by waste gases released into the atmosphere by industries and automobiles; damaging to the environment.
* Bioaccumulation is the accumulation of pollutants in one organism.
* Biomagnification is the movement of pollutants through levels of a food chain so that greater quantities are retained with movement up the food chain.
* An ecological footprint is a calculation of the total area of land and water needed to supply all the materials and energy a human uses, as well as absorb the waste produced.
* Sustainability is when resources of nature are being renewed at least as quickly as they are being used, and all wastes are able to be completely absorbed.
* Reducing is limiting the amount of waste made. (buying less, shorter showers)
* Reusing is using an item over again. (reusable food container, donating clothing)
* Recycling is breaking down products and turning them into something else. (plastic bottles recycled into polar fleece, tires recycled into asphalt)
* Recovering is when waste is converted into a usable form of energy. (cow farts)
* Succession is the process by which new species gradually replace old species in an ecosystem.
* Primary succession is the gradual growth of organisms in an area that was previously bare.
* Secondary succession is the gradual growth of organisms in an area that was formerly home to many species. (regeneration of burned forest)
* Biological control is a method of controlling insect pests using their natural enemies.
* Bioinvasion is when a species that originally exists in a certain part of the planet is introduced into an entirely new location.
* Indicator species is a plant or animal species that helps indicate environmental change.
* When a species is extinct, it no longer exists.
* When it is endangered, the species is in imminent danger of becoming extinct.
* When a species is extirpated in a location, it is extinct there but there are others somewhere else.
* A threatened species is one whose numbers are declining.
* Vulnerable species have faced threats that may cause it to go extinct.
* The pioneer species of an area is the first one to occupy the area.
* A keystone species helps hold an ecosystem together.
* Limiting factors are factors that slow or stop population growth. (food, habitat, predators, water, space)

## Planet Earth

* Earth is broken up into four layers.
* The crust is the thinnest layer and where we live on. It's also the coldest.
* The mantle is the ~~thiccest~~ thickest layer and made of very hot rock. Some parts are even liquid-like.
* The outer core layer is made of iron, nickle, some oxygen, and some sulfur. It's so hot it's liquid.
* The inner core layer is hottest and the center of the Earth. Because of the extreme pressure of being in the center of the Earth, it's solid instead of liquid.
* An incremental change is a slow, gradual change of the Earth's surface.
* Weathering is the breaking down of rocks into smaller pieces (sediments).
* Chemical weathering is when chemicals in the environment react with rocks and break them down. (acid rain, stalactites, stalagmites)
* Mechanical weathering is physical forces wearing away at rocks. (gravity, water, rock-on-rock, frost wedging, wind, glaciers)
* Biological weathering is living organisms breaking down rocks. (tree roots, chemicals in lichen)
* Erosion is the movement of rocks from one place to another.
* Deposition is sediment being dropped in a new location.
* For example, moving water weathers and erodes where it's fast, and deposits sediments where it's slow. This creates landforms.
* Another example is glaciers (moving masses of ice and snow) picking up large rock fragments and carving and scraping the land with them.
* As an example, wind erodes away at rocks and gravity causes rock slides.
* Sudden changes are events that suddenly change the crust of the Earth.
* A volcano is an opening in the Earth's crust where molten rock, ash, and gas escape.
* Inside an active volcano is a chamber where molten rock collects.
* It starts when one plate is forced under another at a boundary.
* Then, pressure from magma and trapped gas builds up inside the chamber, causing magma to move through channels in the rock and escape onto Earth’s surface.
* Magma is molten rock within the Earth's crust.
* Lava is molten rock flowing on the Earth's surface.
* An active volcano has recently erupted.
* An extinct volcano hasn't erupted for tens of thousands of years and isn't expected to erupt again.
* A dormant volcano isn't currently erupting but could erupt at any time.
* The Ring of Fire is an area in the Pacific Ocean where many earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur. They happen along plate boundaries.
* When volcanoes erupt on the ocean floor, they often create underwater mountains and ranges as the lava cools and hardens.
* When they become very large, the mountains become islands coming out of the surface of the ocean.
* Earthquakes are ground vibrations caused by a sudden release of energy when plates strike each other as they are moving. They occur along faults (breaks in the crust).
* The focus is the first place the rocks break in an earthquake.
* The epicenter is the place on the surface directly above the focus and where most damage occurs.
* Seismic waves are energy waves that travel outward from the source of the broken rock. There are three types. (p-waves, s-waves, l-waves (surface))
* The strength of an earthquake's seismic waves is measured with the Richter Scale. It goes from 1 to 10 and an increase of 1 is an increase of 10x the amount of ground motion. (5 is 100x more powerful than 3)
* A seismologist is a scientist that studies seismic waves.
* A seismograph is a device that records seismic waves.
* A seismogram is a graph made by a seismograph.
* Tsunamis are huge powerful waves caused by earthquakes in oceans.
* Rocks are made up of minerals.
* Minerals are naturally occurring, made of elements, and have crystal structures.
* Crystals are atoms arranged in an orderly pattern that repeats.
* Minerals have different properties for describing them.
* The color is the outward appearance and isn't reliable since it can change.
* Lustre is the shininess of a mineral and is how a surface reflects light. (pearly, glassy, waxy, silky, greasy, brilliant, dull, shiny, metallic, glossy).
* The streak is the color of the powder left behind after the mineral rubs a rough surface and isn't always the same color as the mineral.
* Cleavage means that the mineral splits easily into smooth, flat pieces, and a fracture is a break with rough, uneven, and jagged edges.
* Transparent is see-through, translucent is shadowy or frosted, and opaque is not see-through.
* Hardness is how easily the mineral can be scratched and is measured with Moh's Hardness Scale.
* The softest mineral is talc, has a score of one, and can be scratched by a fingernail, the hardest is diamond, has a score of ten, and can scratch all others but not be scratched itself.
* There are three classes of rocks that every rock can be put into.
* An igneous rock is formed when molten rock cools and becomes solid.
* Igneous rocks can be either intrusive or extrusive. Intrusive cool slowly below the surface making big crystals, and extrusive cools quickly on the surface making small crystals.
* Sedimentary rock is created when sediment is compacted and cemented. They have strata (visible layers) and often have fossils.
* A metamorphic rock is one that has been changed from one kind to another through heat and pressure over time. The initial rock is the parent, and the final is the daughter rock.
* These can all be put into a cycle, called the rock cycle. It doesn't have a set order and rocks are always changing.
* The Earth's crust is divided into many slowly moving tectonic plates.
* Continental drift is when the plates slowly drift apart from each other.
* All the continents were originally one big supercontinent known as Pangaea.
* Alfred Wegener originally proposed this idea in 1910.
* The plates are moving very slowly on top of a magma layer in the mantle.
* It moves and undergoes convection currents since magma is liquid and pulls the plates in its direction.
* Boundaries or faults are where plates meet.
* A divergent boundary is where plates move apart. These form ridges (underwater mountains) and rift valleys.
* A convergent boundary is where plates move towards each other. Subduction is when a plate moves under another. These form ocean trenches, volcanoes, volcanic islands, and folded mountains.
* A transform boundary is where plates slide along each other. These result in earthquakes and faults since the movement isn't smooth.
* A mountain is an uplifted area of land. Multiple mountains in a series or chain is a mountain range.
* A fold mountain is a mountain formed through soil folding layers (bending). When plates collide, it causes wrinkles in the top plate; those wrinkles are mountains.
* This is the most common mountain type.
* An anticline is an upfold in the rock, and a syncline is a downfold in the rock.
* Fault mountains occur along fault lines.
* Fault block mountains are formed when faults or cracks in the crust force some blocks of rock up and some down (tension).
* A complex mountain is formed through a combination of faulting and folding in mountains.
* Younger mountains are sharper, and old mountains are rounder.
* Fault mountains occur along fault lines.
* Fault block mountains are formed when faults or cracks in the crust force some blocks of rock up and some down (tension)
* A thrust fault is a break in the Earth's crust, across which older rocks are pushed above younger rocks.
* A fossil is the preserved remains, impression, or trace of any once-living thing from a past age.
* A paleontologist is a person that studies fossils.
* Fossils are found on the surface of the earth and become exposed through weathering, erosion, earthquakes, and human activity. Paleontologists then dig in the same area to find other fossils.
* An organism dies, is buried, and pressure turns the remains into a fossil. Soft parts rarely decompose as they decompose quickly, but hard parts don't.
* An original remains fossil is all or part of the original organism preserved.
* A trace fossil is evidence of animal activity fossilized. (tracks, footprints, wormholes, burrows)
* A mold fossil is the imprint of a fossil.
* A cast fossil is a filled in mold fossil.
* Carbonaceous film is when a carbon film (imprint) is left on the surface of rocks.
* A petrified fossil is when water enters the bone and dissolves the calcium carbonate, and a hard mineral is put in place instead.
* The principle of superposition is the theory that in undisturbed layers of rock, the old layers are at the bottom, and the young rock is at the top.
* Relative dating (no not that) is determining the approximate age of rocks by looking at their position in strata.
* Earth's history is divided into smaller units (eras) based on the appearance of different life forms. This is the geological timescale.
* The Pre-Cambrian era was 4.6 billion to 600 million years ago. The Earth formed and the first life forms were bacteria, algae, fungi, and worms.
* The Paleozoic era was 600 to 225 million years ago. Small amphibians, reptiles, insects, giant ferns were the new life forms. Pangaea was formed, and a mass extinction occurred at the end of the era where 96 of all organisms went extinct.
* The Mesozoic era was 225 to 65 million years ago. The dominant organisms were dinosaurs, reptiles, flowering plants, birds, and mammals. Pangaea started breaking up, and there was a mass extinction at the end of the era.
* The Cenozoic era was 65 million years ago to present day. The dominant organisms were birds, mammals, and flowering plants. The first human-like species came to existence, and the continents moved.
