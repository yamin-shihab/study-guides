## Planet Earth

* Earth is broken up into four layers.
* The crust is the thinnest layer and where we live on. It's also the coldest.
* The mantle is the ~~thiccest~~ thickest layer and made of very hot rock. Some parts are even liquid-like.
* The outer core layer is made of iron, nickle, some oxygen, and some sulfur. It's so hot it's liquid.
* The inner core layer is hottest and the center of the Earth. Because of the extreme pressure of being in the center of the Earth, it's solid instead of liquid.
* An incremental change is a slow, gradual change of the Earth's surface.
* Weathering is the breaking down of rocks into smaller pieces (sediments).
* Chemical weathering is when chemicals in the environment react with rocks and break them down. (acid rain, stalactites, stalagmites)
* Mechanical weathering is physical forces wearing away at rocks. (gravity, water, rock-on-rock, frost wedging, wind, glaciers)
* Biological weathering is living organisms breaking down rocks. (tree roots, chemicals in lichen)
* Erosion is the movement of rocks from one place to another.
* Deposition is sediment being dropped in a new location.
* For example, moving water weathers and erodes where it's fast, and deposits sediments where it's slow. This creates landforms.
* Another example is glaciers (moving masses of ice and snow) picking up large rock fragments and carving and scraping the land with them.
* As an example, wind erodes away at rocks and gravity causes rock slides.
* Sudden changes are events that suddenly change the crust of the Earth.
* A volcano is an opening in the Earth's crust where molten rock, ash, and gas escape.
* Inside an active volcano is a chamber where molten rock collects.
* It starts when one plate is forced under another at a boundary.
* Then, pressure from magma and trapped gas builds up inside the chamber, causing magma to move through channels in the rock and escape onto Earthâ€™s surface.
* Magma is molten rock within the Earth's crust.
* Lava is molten rock flowing on the Earth's surface.
* An active volcano has recently erupted.
* An extinct volcano hasn't erupted for tens of thousands of years and isn't expected to erupt again.
* A dormant volcano isn't currently erupting but could erupt at any time.
* The Ring of Fire is an area in the Pacific Ocean where many earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur. They happen along plate boundaries.
* When volcanoes erupt on the ocean floor, they often create underwater mountains and ranges as the lava cools and hardens.
* When they become very large, the mountains become islands coming out of the surface of the ocean.
* Earthquakes are ground vibrations caused by a sudden release of energy when plates strike each other as they are moving. They occur along faults (breaks in the crust).
* The focus is the first place the rocks break in an earthquake.
* The epicenter is the place on the surface directly above the focus and where most damage occurs.
* Seismic waves are energy waves that travel outward from the source of the broken rock. There are three types. (p-waves, s-waves, l-waves (surface))
* The strength of an earthquake's seismic waves is measured with the Richter Scale. It goes from 1 to 10 and an increase of 1 is an increase of 10x the amount of ground motion. (5 is 100x more powerful than 3)
* A seismologist is a scientist that studies seismic waves.
* A seismograph is a device that records seismic waves.
* A seismogram is a graph made by a seismograph.
* Tsunamis are huge powerful waves caused by earthquakes in oceans.
* Rocks are made up of minerals.
* Minerals are naturally occurring, made of elements, and have crystal structures.
* Crystals are atoms arranged in an orderly pattern that repeats.
* Minerals have different properties for describing them.
* The color is the outward appearance and isn't reliable since it can change.
* Lustre is the shininess of a mineral and is how a surface reflects light. (pearly, glassy, waxy, silky, greasy, brilliant, dull, shiny, metallic, glossy).
* The streak is the color of the powder left behind after the mineral rubs a rough surface and isn't always the same color as the mineral.
* Cleavage means that the mineral splits easily into smooth, flat pieces, and a fracture is a break with rough, uneven, and jagged edges.
* Transparent is see-through, translucent is shadowy or frosted, and opaque is not see-through.
* Hardness is how easily the mineral can be scratched and is measured with Moh's Hardness Scale.
* The softest mineral is talc, has a score of one, and can be scratched by a fingernail, the hardest is diamond, has a score of ten, and can scratch all others but not be scratched itself.
* There are three classes of rocks that every rock can be put into.
* An igneous rock is formed when molten rock cools and becomes solid.
* Igneous rocks can be either intrusive or extrusive. Intrusive cool slowly below the surface making big crystals, and extrusive cools quickly on the surface making small crystals.
* Sedimentary rock is created when sediment is compacted and cemented. They have strata (visible layers) and often have fossils.
* A metamorphic rock is one that has been changed from one kind to another through heat and pressure over time. The initial rock is the parent, and the final is the daughter rock.
* These can all be put into a cycle, called the rock cycle. It doesn't have a set order and rocks are always changing.
* The Earth's crust is divided into many slowly moving tectonic plates.
* Continental drift is when the plates slowly drift apart from each other.
* All the continents were originally one big supercontinent known as Pangaea.
* Alfred Wegener originally proposed this idea in 1910.
* The plates are moving very slowly on top of a magma layer in the mantle.
* It moves and undergoes convection currents since magma is liquid and pulls the plates in its direction.
* Boundaries or faults are where plates meet.
* A divergent boundary is where plates move apart. These form ridges (underwater mountains) and rift valleys.
* A convergent boundary is where plates move towards each other. Subduction is when a plate moves under another. These form ocean trenches, volcanoes, volcanic islands, and folded mountains.
* A transform boundary is where plates slide along each other. These result in earthquakes and faults since the movement isn't smooth.
* A mountain is an uplifted area of land. Multiple mountains in a series or chain is a mountain range.
* A fold mountain is a mountain formed through soil folding layers (bending). When plates collide, it causes wrinkles in the top plate; those wrinkles are mountains.
* This is the most common mountain type.
* An anticline is an upfold in the rock, and a syncline is a downfold in the rock.
* Fault mountains occur along fault lines.
* Fault block mountains are formed when faults or cracks in the crust force some blocks of rock up and some down (tension).
* A complex mountain is formed through a combination of faulting and folding in mountains.
* Younger mountains are sharper, and old mountains are rounder.
* Fault mountains occur along fault lines.
* Fault block mountains are formed when faults or cracks in the crust force some blocks of rock up and some down (tension)
* A thrust fault is a break in the Earth's crust, across which older rocks are pushed above younger rocks.
* A fossil is the preserved remains, impression, or trace of any once-living thing from a past age.
* A paleontologist is a person that studies fossils.
* Fossils are found on the surface of the earth and become exposed through weathering, erosion, earthquakes, and human activity. Paleontologists then dig in the same area to find other fossils.
* An organism dies, is buried, and pressure turns the remains into a fossil. Soft parts rarely decompose as they decompose quickly, but hard parts don't.
* An original remains fossil is all or part of the original organism preserved.
* A trace fossil is evidence of animal activity fossilized. (tracks, footprints, wormholes, burrows)
* A mold fossil is the imprint of a fossil.
* A cast fossil is a filled in mold fossil.
* Carbonaceous film is when a carbon film (imprint) is left on the surface of rocks.
* A petrified fossil is when water enters the bone and dissolves the calcium carbonate, and a hard mineral is put in place instead.
* The principle of superposition is the theory that in undisturbed layers of rock, the old layers are at the bottom, and the young rock is at the top.
* Relative dating (no not that) is determining the approximate age of rocks by looking at their position in strata.
* Earth's history is divided into smaller units (eras) based on the appearance of different life forms. This is the geological timescale.
* The Pre-Cambrian era was 4.6 billion to 600 million years ago. The Earth formed and the first life forms were bacteria, algae, fungi, and worms.
* The Paleozoic era was 600 to 225 million years ago. Small amphibians, reptiles, insects, giant ferns were the new life forms. Pangaea was formed, and a mass extinction occurred at the end of the era where 96 of all organisms went extinct.
* The Mesozoic era was 225 to 65 million years ago. The dominant organisms were dinosaurs, reptiles, flowering plants, birds, and mammals. Pangaea started breaking up, and there was a mass extinction at the end of the era.
* The Cenozoic era was 65 million years ago to present day. The dominant organisms were birds, mammals, and flowering plants. The first human-like species came to existence, and the continents moved.
