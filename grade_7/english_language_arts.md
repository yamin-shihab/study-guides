## Sentences

* A sentence is a group of words that express a complete thought.
* Sentences require a subject (a noun), and a predicate (a verb). *(I drove the car, subject: I, predicate: drove the car)*
* Commands, or requests don't have a subject, just a predicate, but they are still considered sentences since the subject is implied. *(Eat your vegetables!, implied subject: you, predicate: eat your vegetables)*
* Capitals are used for the beginnings of sentences, proper nouns, dates, abbreviations, and proper adjectives. *(The car is fast, Bob, Monday, Chinese food)*
* Periods, exclamation marks, and question marks are used to indicate the sentence has ended, and commas are used to help with the flow of the sentence.
* A declarative sentence makes a sentence, and ends in a period. *(You're ugly.)*
* An interrogative sentence asks a question, and ends in a question mark. *(Who's that guy?)*
* An imperative sentence expresses a command, or request, and ends in a period. *(Open the door.)*
* An exclamatory sentence expresses strong emotion, and ends with an exclamation mark. *(Lets go!)*
* A complete subject is all the words that tell who, or what the sentence is about. *(The big toy)*
* A complete predicate is all the words that tell us what the subject is, or doing. *(Was very expensive)*
* A simple subject is a subject, in which there is only one. *(Steven)*
* A compound subject is one that is two, or more nouns/proper nouns. *(Mars, and Jupiter)*
* A simple predicate is a predicate in which there is only one. *(looked at the man)*
* A compound predicate is one that is two, or more. *(stared at the ice cream, and licked it)*
* A simple sentence (also known as an independent clause), expresses one complete thought. *(Joseph, and Bob, must now fight to the death.)*
* The Oxford Comma rule is when there are lists of at least three items, there's also a comma before the and. *(Pickles, cheese, and juice were all on the list.)*
* A coordinating conjunction is a word that joins two parts of a sentence that are of equal status/ranking/importance. *(The door was closed, but it was unlocked too.)*
* You can use the acronym FANBOYS to remember the common coordinating conjunctions. *(For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So)*
* An independent clause can have meaning on its own.
* Compound sentences are two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction from FANBOYS. *(I turned on the TV, and watched the news.)*
* A dependent clause doesn't express a complete idea, cannot act alone as a sentence as it depends on an independent clause, and always begins with a subordinating conjunction. *(so that I can eat the cake)*
* Subordinating conjunctions include: *after, although, as, because, even if, even though, if, in order to, once, provided that, rather than, since, so that, than, that, though, unless, until, when, whenever, where, whereas, wherever, whether, while, why*.
* A complex sentence contains an independent, and a dependent clause. They begin with a subordinating conjunction. *(Because the boys went to the park, they didn't go to the zoo.)*
