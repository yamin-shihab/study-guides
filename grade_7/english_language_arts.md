## Sentences

* A sentence is a group of words that express a complete thought.
* Sentences require a subject (a noun), and a predicate (a verb). *(I drove the car, subject: I, predicate: drove the car)*
* Commands, or requests don't have a subject, just a predicate, but they are still considered sentences since the subject is implied. *(Eat your vegetables!, implied subject: you, predicate: eat your vegetables)*
* Capitals are used for the beginnings of sentences, proper nouns, dates, abbreviations, and proper adjectives. *(The car is fast, Bob, Monday, Chinese food)*
* Periods, exclamation marks, and question marks are used to indicate the sentence has ended, and commas are used to help with the flow of the sentence.
* A declarative sentence makes a sentence, and ends in a period. *(You're ugly.)*
* An interrogative sentence asks a question, and ends in a question mark. *(Who's that guy?)*
* An imperative sentence expresses a command, or request, and ends in a period. *(Open the door.)*
* An exclamatory sentence expresses strong emotion, and ends with an exclamation mark. *(Lets go!)*
* A complete subject is all the words that tell who, or what the sentence is about. *(The big toy)*
* A complete predicate is all the words that tell us what the subject is, or doing. *(Was very expensive)*
* A simple subject is a subject, in which there is only one. *(Steven)*
* A compound subject is one that is two, or more nouns/proper nouns. *(Mars, and Jupiter)*
* A simple predicate is a predicate in which there is only one. *(looked at the man)*
* A compound predicate is one that is two, or more. *(stared at the ice cream, and licked it)*
* A simple sentence (also known as an independent clause), expresses one complete thought. *(Joseph, and Bob, must now fight to the death.)*
* The Oxford Comma rule is when there are lists of at least three items, there's also a comma before the and. *(Pickles, cheese, and juice were all on the list.)*
* A coordinating conjunction is a word that joins two parts of a sentence that are of equal status/ranking/importance. *(The door was closed, but it was unlocked too.)*
* You can use the acronym FANBOYS to remember the common coordinating conjunctions. *(For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So)*
* An independent clause can have meaning on its own.
* Compound sentences are two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction from FANBOYS. *(I turned on the TV, and watched the news.)*
* A dependent clause doesn't express a complete idea, cannot act alone as a sentence as it depends on an independent clause, and always begins with a subordinating conjunction. *(so that I can eat the cake)*
* Subordinating conjunctions include: *after, although, as, because, even if, even though, if, in order to, once, provided that, rather than, since, so that, than, that, though, unless, until, when, whenever, where, whereas, wherever, whether, while, why*.
* A complex sentence contains an independent, and a dependent clause. They begin with a subordinating conjunction. *(Because the boys went to the park, they didn't go to the zoo.)*

## Paragraphs

* An information paragraph informs, classifies, compares, and explains how, why, or what.
* Narrative paragraphs tell a story, or relay an event.
* A persuasive paragraph presents, and argues your opinion about an issue or topic.
* Descriptive paragraphs describe, in vivid detail, a person, place, or thing.
* When writing a paragraph, you must indent the first sentence.
* And begin with a topic sentence, as an introduction to capture audience's attention.
* You state your topic and show your attitude toward it.
* Develop and support your topic through several details, facts, examples, etc.
* End your paragraph with a concluding statement to summarize the details.
* By restating the main ideas, and/or encouraging your audience to think about what you have written.
* Present only one main idea per paragraph.
* Burgers are sometimes used to give examples of paragraph structure.
* The top bun is the hook, and topic sentence.
* The toppings and meat are the supporting key details.
* The bottom bun is the concluding sentence.
* The hook captures the attention of the reader. This can be done by asking a thoughtful question, sharing a statement, or sharing a meaningful quote. *(Have you ever wondered what happens when you eat 68 hot dogs in a day?)*
* The topic sentence introduces the main idea of the paragraph. This can be done by giving the main idea straight-up, or in chronological order, the supporting ideas. *(There are many stages people must go through when eating a lot of food.)*
* In a paragraph, the topic sentence must be supported with three supporting key details.
* It's important to be specific with details.
* Supporting details expand, and elaborate.
* Each supporting detail should be at least three sentences.
* Transition words add coherence, or flow to writing.
* It's necessary to select an appropriate transition word.
* But it's also a bad idea to overuse them.
* Transition words include: *indeed, obviously, especially, importantly, never, also, furthermore, too, as well as that, besides, in addition, moreover, unlike, nevertheless, on the other hand, while, whereas, even so, first, second, third, finally, following, before, previously, above all*.
* The concluding sentence restates the topic sentence.
* Be sure to not use the same words, though.
* The PEEL method can be used to write paragraphs. *(Point, Evidence, Explanation, Link)*
* Point is what the key detail is discussing.
* Evidence are examples, reasons, details that are used to support the topic sentence.
* Explanation is how the evidence show or prove the topic sentence.
* Link is whether all the ideas connect to the topic of the paragraph.
