# English Language Arts 7

Right now, I'm really, really worried on how I'm going to manage to do Science and Social Studies at this time.

## Sentences

* A sentence is a group of words that express a complete thought.
* Sentences require a subject (a noun) and a predicate (a verb). *(I drove the car, subject: I, predicate: drove the car)*
* Commands or requests don't have a subject, just a predicate, but they are still considered sentences since the subject is implied. *(Eat your vegetables!, implied subject: you, predicate: eat your vegetables)*
* Capitals are used for the beginnings of sentences, proper nouns, dates, abbreviations, and proper adjectives. *(The car is fast, Bob, Monday, Chinese food)*
* Periods, exclamation marks, and question marks are used to indicate the sentence has ended. 
* Commas are used to help with the flow of the sentence.
* A declarative sentence makes a sentence and ends in a period. *(You're ugly.)*
* An interrogative sentence asks a question and ends in a question mark. *(Who's that guy?)*
* An imperative sentence expresses a command or request and ends in a period. *(Open the door.)*
* An exclamatory sentence expresses strong emotion and ends with an exclamation mark. *(Lets go!)*
* A complete subject is all the words that tell who or what the sentence is about. *(The big toy)*
* A complete predicate is all the words that tell us what the subject is or doing. *(Was very expensive)*
* A simple subject is a subject, in which there is only one. *(Steven)*
* A compound subject is one that is two or more nouns/proper nouns. *(Mars and Jupiter)*
* A simple predicate is a predicate in which there is only one. *(looked at the man)*
* A compound predicate is one that is two or more. *(stared at and licked the ice cream)*
* A simple sentence (also known as an independent clause), expresses one complete thought. *(Joseph and Bob must now fight to the death.)*
* The Oxford Comma rule is when there are lists of at least three items, there's also a comma before the and. *(Pickles, cheese, and juice were all on the list.)*
* A coordinating conjunction is a word that joins two parts of a sentence that are of equal status/ranking/importance. *(The door was closed, but it was unlocked too.)*
* You can use the acronym FANBOYS to remember the common coordinating conjunctions. *(For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So)*
* An independent clause can have meaning on its own.
* Compound sentences are two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction from FANBOYS. *(I turned on the TV, and watched the news.)*
* A dependent clause doesn't express a complete idea, cannot act alone as a sentence as it depends on an independent clause and always begins with a subordinating conjunction. *(so that I can eat the cake)*
* Subordinating conjunctions include: *after, although, as, because, even if, even though, if, in order to, once, provided that, rather than, since, so that, than, that, though, unless, until, when, whenever, where, whereas, wherever, whether, while, why*.
* A complex sentence contains an independent and dependent clause. They begin with a subordinating conjunction. *(Because the boys went to the park, they didn't go to the zoo.)*

## Paragraphs

* An information paragraph informs, classifies, compares, and explains how, why, or what.
* Narrative paragraphs tell a story or relay an event.
* A persuasive paragraph presents and argues your opinion about an issue or topic.
* Descriptive paragraphs describe, in vivid detail, a person, place, or thing.
* When writing a paragraph, you must indent the first sentence.
* You also must begin with a topic sentence, as an introduction to capture audience's attention.
* You state your topic and show your attitude toward it.
* Develop and support your topic through several details, facts, examples, etc.
* End your paragraph with a concluding statement to summarize the details.
* By restating the main ideas and/or encouraging your audience to think about what you have written.
* Present only one main idea per paragraph.
* Burgers are sometimes used to give examples of paragraph structure.
* The top bun is the hook and topic sentence.
* The toppings and meat are the supporting key details.
* The bottom bun is the concluding sentence.
* The hook captures the attention of the reader. This can be done by asking a thoughtful question, sharing a statement, or sharing a meaningful quote. *(Have you ever wondered what happens when you eat 68 hot dogs in a day?)*
* The topic sentence introduces the main idea of the paragraph. This can be done by giving the main idea straight-up or in chronological order, the supporting ideas. *(There are many stages people must go through when eating a lot of food.)*
* In a paragraph, the topic sentence must be supported with three supporting key details.
* It's important to be specific with details.
* Supporting details expand and elaborate.
* Each supporting detail should be at least three sentences.
* Transition words add coherence or flow to writing.
* It's necessary to select an appropriate transition word.
* But it's also a bad idea to overuse them.
* Transition words include: *indeed, obviously, especially, importantly, never, also, furthermore, too, as well as that, besides, in addition, moreover, unlike, nevertheless, on the other hand, while, whereas, even so, first, second, third, finally, following, before, previously, above all*.
* The concluding sentence restates the topic sentence.
* Be sure to not use the same words, though.
* The PEEL method can be used to write paragraphs. *(Point, Evidence, Explanation, Link)*
* Point is what the key detail is discussing.
* Evidence are examples, reasons, details that are used to support the topic sentence.
* Explanation is how all the evidence show or prove the topic sentence.
* Link is whether all the ideas connect to the topic of the paragraph.

## Figurative language

* Figurative language calls on the reader's imagination to complete the authors meaning.
* Alliterations are the repetition of words of the same consonant sound of two or more words. *(She sells seashells by the seashore.)*
* A hyperbole is an overstatement or extravagant exaggeration of the fact or possibility used for emphasis or effect. *(I'm so hungry I can eat a horse.)*
* Metaphors are figures of speech which involve an implied comparison between relatively unlike things. *(It's a zoo in here!)*
* An onomatopoeia is a term used for words that sound like what they mean. *(Crash! Bang! Snap!)*
* An oxymoron is when two words with opposite meanings are placed beside each other. *(You look pretty ugly. The movie was awfully good.)*
* Personification is giving human qualities to inanimate objects or ideas. *(The lightning danced across the sky.)*
* Similes are figures of speech in which similarity between two subjects is directly expressed. Usually using "like" or "as". *(The man was like a gorilla. She was as skinny as a blade of grass)*
* An idiom is a word or phrase that has a specific cultural meaning. They usually have a completely different meaning from the literal individual words. *(What a couch potato. I better hit the sack.)*
* A play on words, usually using similar sounds, spellings, and meanings. *(Let's "bee" friends!)*

## Short Stories

* Plot refers to the main events of a story (what happens in the story).
* Exposition is the beginning of the story, and when the author engages the reader and shares essential information to get the story started.
* Background information such as the characters, situation, and setting is told. The mood can also be told from the tone of the exposition.
* The author can start the story in an important conversation, an important/intense event, an action scene, or a description.
* The initial event is the first time when the conflict (problem) of the story is brought to the reader's attention.
* At the beginning, the main character encounters a problem they must face.
* There are two types of conflicts: internal and external.
* Internal conflict comes from within the character.
* External conflict from another character or force outside the character.
* Character vs. self is an internal conflict when the character has a problem with themselves they want to deal with. *(grief, sadness, anger, loss, fear)*
* Character vs. character is an external conflict in which two characters have a problem with each other. *(good guy vs. bad guy)*
* Character vs. nature is an external conflict in which the character has a problem with nature. *(animals, plants)*
* Character vs. supernatural is an external conflict in which the character has a problem with supernatural forces. *(vampires, aliens, werewolves)*
* Character vs. society is an external force in which the character and society have a problem with each other. *(laws, rules)*
* The protagonist is the main character who has a goal to achieve or overcome (not always the "good guy").
* The antagonist is the character whose goal is to prevent the protagonist from succeeding (not always the "bad guy").
* The rising action includes all the events after the initial event, is in the middle of the story, and comprises most of it too.
* Usually as the story progresses, the events get more and more complicated.
* The tension increases in the rising action.
* There are usually three or more events in the rising action.
* The climax is when the main character usually comes face-to-face with their conflict.
* This is the highest point of tension in the story.
* This is the turning point of the story and when the main character may change in some way.
* The falling action is when all loose ends of the plot are tied up. This is the beginning of the end.
* The conflicts and climax are taken care of, and tension decreases.
* The reader knows if the protagonists succeeds or not.
* This part is usually shorter than the rising action.
* The resolution is the final point or outcome of the story when the conflict is explained or solved.
* This is where the reader can determine whether the protagonist has changed.
* A comedy resolution is when the protagonist is successful.
* A tragic resolution is when the protagonist was unsuccessful.
* A resolution could be an unexpected surprise or cliffhanger.
* The resolution is often very short.
* The subplot of a story is the secondary events in a story that usually involve supporting characters.
* A suspenseful story involves the main character in jeopardy or trouble. *(in danger)*
* A flashback is when the author interrupts the main plot and goes back in time.
* They usually give us more background information so that we can better understand characters, setting, conflict, etc.
* They are usually presented as dreams or memories in short stories.
* Foreshadowing is hinting something that will happen in the future.
* They usually happen in the beginning of the story or a chapter.
* They set expectations about what will happen later on in the plot.
* Dialogue shows that two or more characters are talking to each other.
* They can show the characters' personality, motives, and feelings more clearly.
* By the end of the story, there should be a bigger message in mind about life and what it means to be human for the reader to connect to. *(pride, jealousy, greed, fairness)*
* So theme is the point or central message in a story and connects us with the characters and events.
* Characters are usually human (but not always) players in the story.
* A static character stays the same throughout the story.
* A dynamic character changes throughout the story, whether it's good or bad.
* A flat character can be summed up simply because of not being very detailed and not having much information.
* A round character has lots of information, is complex, interesting, and motivated. They are usually a major character since the author spends time describing them.
* A stock (stereotypical) character is generally a flat character, is stereotyped, often appears in literature, and is easily identifiable.
* They are put in similar roles each time.
* Irony is unexpected. It's the opposite of what the character thinks, believes, or expects. *(calling the tallest person "Shorty", calling a flat town "Summit")*
