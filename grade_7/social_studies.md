Will I ever manage to finish this and science in time while having a bunch of assignments and tests? Tune in to find out! Yeah, I'm going to try to write short.

## Chapter 9

* In Rupert's Land, there was the Red River Settlement; it was home to many people such as French and English-speaking Metis people.
* The Red River Resistance occurred in 1869 because after the HBC sold Rupert's Land to Canada for 300 000 pounds, land surveyors appeared to divide and mark land too early.
* They weren't consulted when the land they lived on was sold.
* Louis Riel was born in the Red River settlement as a Metis. He was very well-educated since he graduated knowing many languages as well as science.
* Louis Riel famously stopped surveyors from crossing his cousin's farm in October.
* Riel and the Metis people then took control of Fort Garry, the major HBC trading post in the vicinity, peacefully.
* They then issued a provisional (temporary) government and issued the Declaration of the People of Rupert's Land and the North-West. Louis Riel was chosen president.
* After a group of people from Ontario tried to overthrow the provisional government, the group was arrested.
* They thought that only British Protestants should have power over other people.
* They then convicted, shot, and killed one of them named Thomas Scott.
* Some people said it was justified, some didn't.
* Many people in Ontario didn't like Riel and the Metis since the Death of Thomas Scott and the takeover of fort Garry leading to the provisional government.
* The Manitoba Act brought the settlement of Red River as an officially bilingual province to Canada.
* It gave many rights to the people of Red River and people that wanted to settle there.
* In the South Branch communities, Metis people from Red River started over, established farms, and worked for the fur trade.
* Canada set up the North West Mounted Police in 1873 for the territory, and they planned to build a railway across the west to BC.
* The South Branch Metis sent petitions starting in the early 1870s to stop this. But land surveyors (people that buy land to later sell it for more) have already started to arrive.
* In 1884, a leader from those communities named Gabriel Dumont went to seek the help of Louis Riel in Montana (where he has become a schoolteacher and started a family).
* The Metis heard that troops were coming to their area, so they set up a provisional government at Batoche.
* It turned out that there were no troops coming, but they did when they started the provisional government.
* 600 troops arrived, the battle of Batoche lasted three days, and 100 Metis and Canadian people died.
* Riel gave himself up and was charged with treason, found guilty, and executed.
* He was said to be charged for treason because of the battle, and executed for the murder of Thomas Scott.
* However, not even one person of the jury was Francophone.
* The Canadian government then took steps to suppress the control of First Nations and Metis people.
* When the Manitoba Act was negotiated, more than 50% of the population was Catholic and spoke French. By 1890, that changed to 15%.
* So the Manitoba School Act made Manitoba change from bilingual to English only, and made schools only English.

## Chapter 10

* To own land that First Nations live in, Canada had to negotiate numbered treaties.
* This was needed to do things like expand west and build the railway.
* Treaties were also used to assimilate the First Nations to be more "British" by forcing them to give up their cultural ways.
* Canada made industrial residential schools for First Nations children as their promise for their education and a way to assimilate them into British society by separating them from their family and culture.
* The government of Canada founded the NWMP (North West Mounted Police) in 1873 following a massacre of 36 Nakoda people by a group of American and Canadian traders over an argument about some horses in what is now Southern Alberta. 
* They were founded because of fears that the Americans would work with the Indians (the word used to identify First Nations then), to take control of the west.
* The NWMP developed a trust with First Nations that helped them keep peace in the west as the railway advanced and settlers arrived. They advised First Nations to conclude treaties with the government.
* In 1873, John A. MacDonald lost a federal election after accepting the "Pacific Scandal". But he then won the next one five years later by stating the three part plan known as the National Policy:
1. Promote Canadian industry by adding a tariff (tax) to American products so that people buy Canadian products instead.
2. Finish the national railway that connects the east with the west.
3. Settle the west by encouraging European immigrants to come to Canada by giving free land. They'd grow grain for export and would buy products from Canadian industries.
* The government recruited many men from China to work on the CPR (Canadian Pacific Railway). By 1885, there were nearly 15 000 Chinese construction workers in BC.
* They tried to send their earnings home to China so that their loved ones and family members can come to Canada, however this was impossible since the Chinese workers were paid less than others.
* When the CPR was complete, many Chinese Canadians helped establish the lumber and cannery industries but faced discrimination.
* A law was introduced in 1885 to restrict Chinese immigration to Canada. First it was $50 ($2 500 now), but they kept coming, so the tax kept increasing.
* Between 1885 and 1920, more than 82 000 Chinese people paid the tax and immigrated to Canada.
* John A. MacDonald wanted the west to be populated, since by 1890 only 2% of the population lived in the west.
* This changed when Wilfrid Laurier became prime minister. His Minister of the Interior (Clifford Sifton) began an advertisement campaign to attract immigrants.
* It targeted the US, Britain, and many parts of Europe, but not French-speaking populations such as France, Belgium, or Switzerland.
* This was because he (and many others) believed that "British was best".
* However, people came from many places such as Ukraine, Russia and Poland. This gave Canada many cultures all the way to today.
