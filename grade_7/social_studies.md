# Social Studies 7

Will I ever manage to finish this and science in time while having a bunch of assignments and tests? Tune in to find out! Yeah, I'm going to try to write short.

## Chapter 9

* In Rupert's Land, there was the Red River Settlement; it was home to many people such as French and English-speaking Metis people.
* The Red River Resistance occurred in 1869 because after the HBC sold Rupert's Land to Canada for 300 000 pounds, land surveyors appeared to divide and mark land too early.
* They weren't consulted when the land they lived on was sold.
* Louis Riel was born in the Red River settlement as a Metis. He was very well-educated.
* Louis Riel stopped surveyors from crossing his cousin's farm in October.
* Riel and the Metis people then took control of Fort Garry, the major HBC trading post in the vicinity, peacefully.
* They then issued a provisional (temporary) government and issued the Declaration of the People of Rupert's Land and the North-West. Louis Riel was chosen president.
* After a group of people from Ontario tried to overthrow the provisional government, the group was arrested.
* They thought that only British Protestants should have power over other people.
* They then convicted, shot, and killed one of them named Thomas Scott.
* Some people said it was justified, some didn't.
* Many people in Ontario didn't like Riel and the Metis since the Death of Thomas Scott and the takeover of fort Garry leading to the provisional government.
* The Manitoba Act brought the settlement of Red River as an officially bilingual province to Canada.
* It gave many rights to the people of Red River and people that wanted to settle there.
* In the South Branch communities, Metis people from Red River started over, established farms, and worked for the fur trade.
* Canada set up the North West Mounted Police in 1873 for the territory, and they planned to build a railway across the west to BC.
* The South Branch Metis sent petitions starting in the early 1870s to stop this. But land surveyors (people that buy land to later sell it for more) have already started to arrive.
* In 1884, a leader from those communities named Gabriel Dumont went to seek the help of Louis Riel in Montana (where he has become a schoolteacher and started a family).
* The Metis heard that troops were coming to their area, so they set up a provisional government at Batoche.
* It turned out that there were no troops coming, but they did when they started the provisional government.
* 600 troops arrived, the battle of Batoche lasted three days, and 100 Metis and Canadian people died.
* Riel gave himself up and was charged with treason, found guilty, and executed.
* The Canadian government then took steps to suppress the control of First Nations and Metis people.
* When the Manitoba Act was negotiated, more than 50% of the population was Catholic and spoke French. By 1890, that changed to 15%.
* So the Manitoba School Act made Manitoba change from bilingual to English only, and made schools only English.
