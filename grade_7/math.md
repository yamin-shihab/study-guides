# Math 7

This subject probably involves the least amount of studying because you'll be thinking more than the other subjects instead of just remembering.

## Divisibility Rules

* A number is divisible by **1** when it's an integer. *(123, 543, 923754089123740812490)*
* A number is divisible by **2** when the last digit is even. *(6, 92, 412342)*
* A number is divisible by **3** when the sum of all of its digits are a multiple of **3**. *(135, 5 706, 16 587)*
* A number is divisible by **4** when the number made by the last two digits are divisible by **4**. *(416, 56, 29 24)*
* A number is divisible by **5** when the last digit is either a **5** or **0**. *(125, 85, 1 050)*
* A number is divisible by **6** when it's divisible by both **2** and **3**. *(312, 5 706, 625 872)*
* A number is divisible by **8** when the number made by the last 3 digits are divisible by 8. *(3032, 304, 62 937)*
* A number is divisible by **9** when the sum of all digits is a multiple of **9**. *(496, 18, 51 840)*
* A number is divisible by **10** when the last digit is a **0**. *(40, 500, 48 620)*
* You can use a Venn Diagram to sort numbers by their divisibility (the two circle chart thingy with a separate spot in the middle).
