# Math 7

This subject probably involves the least amount of studying because you'll be thinking more than the other subjects instead of just remembering. Practicing word problems is also cool for practice.

## Divisibility Rules

* The following are rules to tell if a number is divisible by some certain number.
* **1** when it's an integer. *(123, 543, 2 490)*
* **2** when the last digit is even. *(6, 92, 412 342)*
* **3** when the sum of all of its digits are a multiple of **3**. *(135, 5 706, 16 587)*
* **4** when the number made by the last two digits are divisible by **4**. *(416, 56, 29 24)*
* **5** when the last digit is either a **5** or **0**. *(125, 85, 1 050)*
* **6** when it's divisible by both **2** and **3**. *(312, 5 706, 625 872)*
* **8** when the number made by the last 3 digits are divisible by 8. *(3 032, 304, 62 937)*
* **9** when the sum of all digits is a multiple of **9**. *(496, 18, 51 840)*
* **10** when the last digit is a **0**. *(40, 500, 48 620)*
* You can use a Venn Diagram to sort numbers by their divisibility (the two circle chart thingy with a separate spot in the middle).

## Integers

* Positive numbers are above **0**, and negative numbers are below **0** and are prefixed with a "-".
* It may sometimes be more clear to surround numbers with parenthesis.
* If you are adding/subtracting two numbers that are positive and negative, you can reverse the sign (negative or not) of the second number, and reverse the operation (addition to subtraction and vice versa).
* Number tiles are a way to represent numbers by having specific tiles for either **-1** or **+1**.
* For example, *red tiles can be positive, and yellow tiles can be negative*.
* One tile from each together make a zero pair (which are usually circled together into a "bubble").
* A zero pair is equal to... Well, **0**.
* So for example, ***5** red tiles and **2** yellow tiles make **3***
* To add two numbers represented by number tiles:
1. Model both numbers with number tiles.
2. Circle all zero pairs.
3. Count the remaining number tiles; that's the answer.
* Adding example: ***-6** + **2**: draw **6** yellow tiles, **2** red tiles are added, remove the **two** zero pairs, there are now **4** yellow tiles, the answer is **-4***.
* To subtract two numbers represented by number tiles:
1. Model the first number with number tiles.
2. Can the amount from the second number be taken away from the first number? If so, do so.
3. If not, make enough zero pairs to subtract the second number (by adding negative tiles if more positive tiles are needed to be subtracted, or by adding positive tiles if more negative tiles are needed to be subtracted).
* Subtracting example: ***5** - **-2**: draw **5** red tiles, there are no yellow (negative) tiles to take away (you need **two**), draw **2** zero pairs for **2** yellow tiles, remove the **2** yellow tiles, you now have **7** red tiles, the answer is 7*.

## Decimals

* You should know basic math operations by now (like long addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication).
* The product is the answer of multiplication, the quotient is the answer of division.
* Front-end estimations is only using the whole number of a decimal number. *(1.4 -> 1, 5.6 -> 5, 66.9 -> 66)*
* Rounding estimation is rounding to the nearest nth (tenth, hundredth, thousandth) place. *(1.4 -> 1, 5.6 -> 6, 66.9 -> 67)*
* PEDMAS (how dare people say BEDMAS!) is the order in which operations are applied in an equation.
* Parenthesis, Exponent, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction.
* Note that when division/multiplication or addition/subtraction is reached, it is either one of the parts of those current pairs are applied from left to right.

## Fractions, Decimals, and Percents

* Percent means out of 100.
* A terminating decimal number has a finite number of decimal places. *(4.6, 16.72, 134.154)*
* A repeating decimal number has a specific pattern of numbers that repeat forever. *(PI, 10 / 3, 100 / 33)*
* Repeating decimal numbers have a straight line on top of them to show that they are repeating from the current decimals.
* Equivalent fractions are fractions that all represent the same amount, despite being different (imagine groups of small pizza slices being in the shape of one big pizza slice). *(3/9, 1/3, 2/6)*
* A simplified fraction is the smallest possible equivalent fraction for a fraction.
* To find one for a fraction, divide the numerator and denominator by the largest common factor. *(65/100's largest common factor is 5 -> 65 / 5 = 13, 100 / 5 = 20 -> simplified fraction: 13/20)*
* Common factors are factors (numbers multiplied together to get a product) that are present in two or more numbers.
* To convert a fraction to decimal, convert the denominator to the nearest power of 10 by multiplying or dividing, then do the specific operation on the numerator, then make the decimal the numerator in the appropriate place value. *(13/200 -> 65/1000 -> 0.065)*
* If the denominator cannot become a power of **10**, divide the numerator by the denominator. *(1/7 -> 1 / 7 -> 0.142 857)*
* To convert a decimal to fraction, the place value of the last digit becomes the denominator, and the original number becomes the numerator. *(0.561 -> 561/1000)*
* The following are rules for each denominator to be applied to the numerator to make the decimal.
* **/2** -> half the number.
* **/3** -> **0.3** repeated, **0.6** repeated.
* **/4** -> multiply by **0.25**.
* **/5** -> multiply by **2**.
* **/8** -> repeat after decimal.
* **/10** -> prefixed by **0**.
* **/11** -> multiplied by **9** and then repeats.
* To convert a fraction to a percent, convert it to decimal, then move the decimal **2** places to the right, then add the **%** sign. *(4/5 -> 0.8 -> 80%)*
* To convert from percent to fraction, the number becomes the numerator and the denominator becomes **100**. *(55% -> 55/100)*
* To convert from a decimal to a percent, either multiply the decimal by **100**, or move the decimal **2** places to the right, and always add the **%** sign. *(0.18 -> 18%)*
* To convert from percent to decimal, drop the **%** sign, and either move the decimal **2** places to the left, or divide the number by **100**. *(75% -> 0.75)*
* When comparing fractions, decimals, and percents, it's best to convert them all to one of those formats, then reorder them, then turn them back to their original form.
