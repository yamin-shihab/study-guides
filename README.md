# study-guides

My (so far only) grade 7 Alberta curriculum finals study guides. Feel free to share this around (other classes, grades, schools, can this even get outside of Alberta?)

## Contributing:

* Learn how to make a pull request on GitHub.
* Learn Markdown syntax: [this is a good resource](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/markdown/).
* Header 1 at top of every file (stating subject).
* Each unit is a header 2 after that.
* Sections are separated by a newline.
* Parts of a unit are part of an unordered list.
* Use * instead of - or + for unordered lists.
* Don't make parts too long.
* Use correct spelling and grammar.
* I like the Oxford Comma.
* Separate every three digits of a number with a space (not a comma).
* You may use *italics*, **bold**, and ALL-CAPS for emphasis (***ONLY FOR EMPHASIS***).
* I prefer to use **bold for numbers**, and *italics for examples*.
* ***Please*** stay consistent.
* If you only want to point something simple out, submit an issue (not a pull request).
