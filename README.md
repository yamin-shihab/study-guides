# study-guides

My (so far only) grade 7 Alberta curriculum finals study guides. Feel free to share this around (other classes, grades, schools, can this even get outside of Alberta?)

## Contributing:

* Learn how to make a pull request on GitHub.
* Learn Markdown syntax: [this is a good resource](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/markdown/).
* __Header 1__ at top of every file (stating __subject__).
* Each __unit__ is a __header 2__ after that.
* __Sections__ are separated by a __newline__.
* __Parts__ of a unit are part of an __unordered list__.
* Use * instead of - or + for unordered lists.
* Don't make parts too long.
* Use __correct__ spelling and grammar.
* I like the Oxford Comma.
* Separate every __three digits__ of a number with a __space__ (not a comma).
* You may use *italics*, **bold**, ALL-CAPS, and __underline__ for emphasis (***ONLY FOR EMPHASIS***).
* I prefer to use __underline for words__, **bold for numbers**, and *italics for examples*.
* __***Please***__ stay consistent.
* If you only want to point something simple out, submit an issue (not a pull request).
